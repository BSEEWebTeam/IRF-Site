          <h2>TOPICAL ISSUES          </h2>
          <h3>Asset Integrity          </h3>
          <p>At the December 2007 conference in Miami, where the theme of the conference was asset integrity, delegates requested IRF to more clearly define what was meant by the term, what should be included and what IRF expectations were with respect to the key processes which should be in place to ensure asset integrity.  In response to this request the following definitions and key processes set out the views of the regulators who form the IRF          
          <h2>Definitions          </h2>
          <h3>Outcome:          </h3>
          <p>An asset (which includes structure, process plant and connected wells and pipelines) has integrity when it meets design performance standards for effective control of risks and when the management systems effectively support those standards.          
          <h3>Process:          </h3>
          <p>Effective integrity management means knowing:          
          <ul>
            <li>all about the design and safe operation of all plant, equipment and systems, </li>
            <li> what can go wrong. </li>
            <li>effective measures are in place to prevent and control undesired outcomes. </li>
            <li>personnel are trained and competent. </li>
            <li>monitoring, inspection and auditing arrangements will verify that the desired outcome is achieved. </li>
            </ul>
          <p>The following represent IRF&rsquo;s reasonable expectations for what needs to be in place for companies to demonstrate effective management of the integrity of an asset.</p>
          <ul>
            <li> effective leadership from the top demonstrating understanding of integrity issues and commitment to safe operation.</li>
            <li> clear and effective performance indicators.</li>
            <li>appropriate management metrics at all levels of management.</li>
            <li>effective management of integrity data.</li>
            <li>meaningful and effective performance standards.</li>
            <li>appropriate design standards</li>
            <li>comprehensive operations and maintenance management systems .</li>
            <li> effective risk assessment tools and procedures</li>
            <li>effective audit of integrity management performance.</li>
            <li>effective cross business and cross industry learning.</li>
            <li>continuity of records during the lifetime of the asset.</li>
            <li> trained and competent workforce.</li>
            <li>clear management of change procedures.</li>
            <li>knowledge and understanding of risk control barriers at all levels.</li>
            </ul>
