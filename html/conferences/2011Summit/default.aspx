          <p><strong>In the wake of the recent disasters that have struck the offshore petroleum industry, the International Regulators&rsquo; Forum (IRF) organised an extraordinary safety Summit Conference in Stavanger on 4 and 5 October, hosted by the  Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA).</strong></p>

          <p>The disasters which struck the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig/Macondo oil well in the Mexican Gulf in the spring of 2010, and the West Atlas rig/Montara oil field in the Timor Sea in August 2009, have caused a paradigm shift in attitudes and requirements relating to safety and environmental protection in offshore petroleum activities.</p>

          <p>Consequently, a range of work is being conducted nationally, regionally and internationally to establish and promote the highest safety and environmental standards within this global industry. IRF, which comprises the key national offshore safety authorities across the world, was anxious to provide a conference for all global/regional bodies, offshore operators, contractors and workforce representatives to share the outcomes of all the post-Macondo work, and to take this work forward in a coordinated manner.</p>

          <p>In addition to presentations from the key players in the various safety, environmental and political work streams following on from Deepwater Horizon, the Summit provided an opportunity to identify what more needed to be done to take forward and coordinate this crucial agenda.  The conference also heard about the work that IRF is taking forward on its five areas of offshore safety priority:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Safety culture and leadership,</li>
          <li>BOP integrity and well control operational issues, </li>
          <li>Use of standards and industry best practice</li>
          <li>Further development of performance indicators for measuring the member countries' health, safety and environment performance, </li>
          <li>Establishment of necessary criteria for the members' acceptance of companies' competency and capacity,  </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Following the Summit Conference, the organisers issued an <a href="/conferences/2011Summit/IRF 2011 Summit Conference Communique.pdf">IRF Communiqu&eacute;</a> summarising the conference activities and outcomes.</p>

          <p>The IRF thanks all those who attended this event, and is pleased to provide access to the key <a href="/conferences/2011Summit/downloads.aspx">documents and presentations</a> of the conference.
