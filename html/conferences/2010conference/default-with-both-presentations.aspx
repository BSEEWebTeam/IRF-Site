          <h2>2010 conference - Offshore Safety: Where do we go from here?</h2>
          <p>Through 24/7 media coverage, people around the world have been alerted to the serious risks involved in offshore drilling following the explosion of BP's Deepwater Horizon on April 20th, 2010 killing 11 workers, injuring 28 others and causing millions of barrels of oil to flow uncontrolled into the Gulf of Mexico. The International Regulators Forum is bringing together leading experts from around the world to discuss lessons learned from the Montara and Macondo blowouts in an effort to improve the management and reduction of risks. The conference will provide an opportunity for the sharing of information and exchange of ideas among regulators and industry on best practices.</p>

<p>The conference built on the discussions from the previous conference held in Miami in 2007. Other topics addressed include managing technological, human resource and organizational changes in a constantly changing environment; performance indicators; continuous improvement programs; and challenges ahead for regulators.</p>

<p>Leading government and industry experts from 20 nations will share their best practices for safety offshore over the three day conference. Also during the conference, the Carolita Kallaur Award for Leadership and International Safety Achievement will be presented at a Gala Dinner.</p>
