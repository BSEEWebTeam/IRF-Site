          <h1><strong>2010 conference</strong><br />Offshore Safety: Where do we go from here?</h1>
          <h2>Protocol for Media Participation</h2>
The IRF Conference is a not-for-profit event, which brings together offshore regulators and offshore industry to discuss issues of mutual interest and concern relating to offshore safety. <br>
<br>
Media are welcome to attend the conference and to report on proceedings, but participation will be restricted to day events only. Lunch and nutrition breaks are provided, but access to the Welcoming Reception, evening dinners and Gala Dinner is restricted to full delegates only. <br>
<br>
The conference fee is waived for media. You are responsible for your own travel, accommodations and expenses. <br>
<br>
Registration may be done on-line, or at the event. Media are required to present their credentials at the registration desk when picking up your event pass. Failure to do so may result in access being denied to the proceedings. <br>
<br>
Your event pass should remain on you at all times throughout the conference proceedings. <br>
<br>
Media can report on each session, but are asked not to attribute comments made during the sessions to specific individuals, or speakers, without their express permission. <br>

<br>
A separate media room is available for on-on-one interviews or scrums, if needed. Requests for interviews with individual delegates should be made through the Media Managers. <br>
<br>
We thank you for your interest in the work of the IRF and look forward to meeting you at the conference. <br>
