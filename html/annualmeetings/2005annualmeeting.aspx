        <h2>Annual Meetings</h2>
        <p><strong>12th 
          Annual IRF MEETING</strong>
          <strong>19-21 September 2005, Craigellachie          </strong>          </p>
        <p><strong>DAY 1, 19th September</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1. Lifting</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> IRF endorsed the strategy proposed by Ian Paterson and requested 
              he produce the first progress report by April 2006, the anniversary 
              of IRF international conference. </li>
            <li>Ian Paterson will develop the templates to be used by each country; 
              inputs by members will take account of the different regulations within 
              the countries.</li>
            <li> Strategy to be shared with OGP and IADC (IMCA too?), consideration 
              to be given to establishing a high level working group. </li>
            <li>OGP lifting guidance expected in Jan/Feb 2006. IRF notes it would 
              be a first for industry to produce guidance against which they will 
              later be measured by IRF.</li>
            <li> The high level Working Group, (if established), to consider the management 
              of the database &#8211; OGP, IADC, ICRARD? The default position would 
              be to use the IRF website. Final decision to be taken by IRF.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>2. Performance Measures</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>IRF reviewed the data, and agreed that they were not yet in a position 
              to release individual country data, although this remained the ultimate 
              goal. </li>
            <li>Further refinement to the data was required, with data from other, 
              currently non-contributory IRF members available over time.</li>
            <li> It was agreed that aggregated IRF data would be published subject 
              to the information being cleared by members first. IRF requested Melinda 
              produce the new summary information (which would become de facto a baseline 
              of performance for IRF member countries). As well as being published 
              on member websites, it was suggested the data be offered to the DNV 
              global incident reporting site.</li>
            <li> Criteria for harmonising performance measures between countries are 
              also to be published (with the data). </li>
            <li>Melinda to gather information (events and causes) of significant hydrocarbon 
              release events, incorporating the UK/Norway criteria for such events, 
              and circulate to IRF members. IRF would later consider the merits of 
              publishing a report. </li>
            <li>Netherlands is prepared to instruct their industry to report HCR in 
              line with IRF (UK/Norway) standards.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>3. Drilling Practices Committee</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> IRF members agreed to develop the proposal submitted by USA and invited 
              Don Howard to take the necessary steps. </li>
            <li>It was agreed the proposed start-up issues namely:<br />
              - Managed pressure drilling<br />
              - Surface BOP&#8217;s on floating MODU&#8217;s<br />
              - HTHP wells<br />
              are relevant to all members but there are others that should be taken 
              into account.</li>
            <li> As a first step, IRF requested Don&#8217;s new Committee canvas views 
              from each country, and develop an IRF priority issues list (similar 
              to the approach adopted for the lifting and performance measures projects). 
              It was hoped the first list could be prepared by April 2006. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>4. Netherlands &#8211; Perception of Safety Theme Workshop</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>A very relevant report, with Human Factor issues embedded within the 
              document. IRF observed the summary captured cultural and other human 
              factors that are important to each member country.</li>
            <li> Report to be placed on the IRF Website. </li>
            <li>IRF keen to learn of follow-up actions taken within the companies 
              at the next meeting. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>5. UK - Human Factors</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Another very relevant presentation delivered by Rob Miles.</li>
            <li> Presentation to be placed on the IRF website.</li>
            <li> Small and informal Human Factors &#8217;sharing club&#8217; to be 
              established between UK, Netherlands and Australia (other members welcome). 
              Rob Miles to be invited to set up the club. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>6. US &#8211; Hurricane Issues and Thunder Horse </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overarching theme from 27th July workshop with industry reviewing 
              Hurricanes Andrew and Ivan, was the reluctance of industry to respond 
              to inadequate standards especially, in this case, mooring standards</li>
            <li> The benefit of the regulator (MMS in this situation) is clearly demonstrated 
              in its persistence in tabling the issues and confronting industry with 
              its responsibility to implement suitable risk controls. Aftermath of 
              Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is likely to reduce resistance of industry.</li>
            <li> UK will obtain electronic version of the BP Thunder Horse report 
              to add to the MMS report for the IRF memory stick. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>7. US - New Regulatory Approach </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Statistical evidence was presented that safety performance on the 
              USCS is getting worse, and MMS is considering a mandatory Safety Environmental 
              Management Program.</li>
            <li> IRF endorsed the suggestion to hold a special IRF workshop as an 
              opportunity to compare suitability of different regulatory regimes and 
              assist USA to develop its supervisory programmes. If it goes ahead, 
              IRF suggested the workshop examine the boundary between the regulator 
              and the duty holder in terms of managing risks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>8. UK &#8211; Asset Integrity </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The presentation demonstrated validity of the template approach that 
              has been agreed for the lifting programme.</li>
            <li> In addition to the existing leading indicator (LI) two new LI&#8217;s 
              for asset integrity have been agreed with UK industry: <br />
              - &#8216;n&#8217; as the number of non compliances reported by independent 
              verifiers that remain open at the end of each month<br />
              - monthly production shortfall reported against planned maximum monthly 
              production</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>9. PSA - OGP/IADC</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Magne had circulated to IRF members a recent response from OGP to 
              the IRF request for further clarification of global variations in safety 
              performance amongst OGP member companies.</li>
            <li> Magne will continue to pursue the IADC response. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>DAY 2, 20th September</strong></p>
          <p><strong>10. Canada Nova Scotia -The Future of IRF</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> IRF decided that it would not take environmental issues into its 
              remit, but acknowledged the inevitable inter-relation between safety 
              and the environment. and would remain aware of the relationship.</li>
            <li> IRF recognised that there was a natural tendency to contribute at 
              different levels often depending on resources available to different 
              member countries. However IRF did not want to formally adopt different 
              tiers of membership.</li>
            <li> It was accepted that the IRF Global Conference was a key event, ascribing 
              irresistable momentum for change that requires reporting back to conference 
              delegates via the IRF website (see below).</li>
            <li> 4. IRF considered expanding its membership to include India&#8217;s 
              OISD, but could not agree on the generic point of expansion. It was 
              instead agreed to make a strategic assessment of expanding IRF. Stuart 
              agreed to canvas ideas from members and prepare a further paper on expansion 
              issues, taking into account the following: <br />
              - Whether we want to expand and why, and if so what criteria should 
              be applied for additional membership? <br />
              - Whether safety and economics are integral or relative. There was insufficient 
              time to debate where the economic parameters should be incorporated 
              and the paper could usefully address this.<br />
              - Are there alternative strategies that could expand IRF&#8217;s objectives?<br />
              - Whether further expansion would secure greater international interest 
              in IRF&#8217;s views and programmes, and secure greater leverage to 
              achieve our objective of improving global performance.<br />
              - Aim to have first draft in circulation by early January 2006. </li>
            <li>Taf to write to Mr Verma, Director of OISD to inform him of IRF&#8217;s 
              decisions and proposed actions regarding expanding membership. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>11. Canada, Newfoundland - Website and residual funding</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Surplus funds from 2005 Global Conference to be rolled forward for 
              next conference, less any used to maintain existing IRF website for 
              the time being. </li>
            <li>Current website to be retained to capture documents from IRF Craigellachie 
              Conference, but would not be used for the next conference. </li>
            <li>New website to be developed along the lines of ICRARD (Norway), owned 
              and maintained by IRF with a three year turnover between members. First 
              site steward to be agreed between US and UK. Post conference update: 
              UK has agreed to take stewardship of website for first period (to December 
              2008). </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>12. Canada, Newfoundland &#8211; Practical outcomes in response 
            to delegates at IRF conference (this is a summary of relevant agreed actions 
            up to this point in the meeting)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Commitment to create a website that provided information to the wider 
              community by April 2006 (Section 11, above - UK).</li>
            <li> Lifting template and toolkit to be available by April 2006 (Section 
              1 - UK).</li>
            <li> International performance measures/standards in process of development, 
              with commitment to publish combined IRF data, performance measure criterion 
              and &#8216;most significant&#8217; hydrocarbon release incidents, with 
              causes (Section 2 - USA).</li>
            <li> Decision made to keep status quo of IRF membership for the time being, 
              awaiting outcome of discussions of IRF vision and strategy (Section 
              10 - Canada Nova Scotia).</li>
            <li> Drilling working group to be created and to investigate global priority 
              issues (Section 3 - USA).</li>
            <li> OGP/IADC regional performance differences &#8211; reply had been 
              received from OGP, IADC yet to reply (Section 9 - Norway).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>DAY 3, 21st September</strong></p>
          <p><strong>13. Norway &#8211; New issues and emerging risks</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>USA: there is recycling of well known risks placing technical challenges 
              on industry. Industry lacks commitment to raise standards. Exploration 
              strategies of majors are unclear.</li>
            <li> Netherlands: NL aims to increase focus on human factors in the safety 
              case. Newer operators are acquiring relinquished and fallow assets presenting 
              a competency challenge for SSM.</li>
            <li> UK: concerned at critical damage made to supply side of industry 
              by major operators during past 3 - 4 years of global reorganisation.</li>
            <li> Brazil: new FPSO intended for Brazilian CS. Floating sea-tank design 
              that will also emerge elsewhere (e.g. UK).</li>
            <li> Australia: also experiencing problems associated with supply chain 
              degradation. Twenty eight rigs being built in Singapore and have noted 
              poor fabrication and technical standards that challenge project integrity 
              of oilfield customers in Australia.</li>
            <li> Norway: integrated and remote controlled operations present challenges 
              for PSA. New concept FPF by Aker Kvaerner proposes permanently unmanned 
              production facilities, eliminating many safety risks, effectively moving 
              subsea concept to topsides.</li>
            <li> Norway: recent lifeboat issues. Design, commissioning and testing 
              criteria are inappropriate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Actions arising from discussion:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Norway will produce a paper concerning the design and testing codes 
              for lifeboats with a view to developing an IRF stance through consultation. 
              Particular emphasis to design codes and test criteria. Influence could 
              be channelled through IMO and change brought about through each country&#8217;s 
              regulatory regime.</li>
            <li> UK will produce a &#8216;kick off&#8217; paper detailing issues with 
              supply chain management. It would be difficult to regulate, but useful 
              for the IRF to issue statements of their observations and expectations.</li>
            <li> Small informal workgroup on human factors will be set up, made up 
              of John, Roel and Taf. Other members welcome. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>14. USA - Global Conference</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Agreement that the UK hosted conference had been a success relative 
              to IRF&#8217;s remit and further agreement that IRF should aim to organise 
              further conferences every three years.</li>
            <li> Next conference may be held in the US. Bud to confirm that the US 
              is able to be host, and to advise the date &#8211; possibly Spring 2008. 
              Norway may be able to host the event if US are unable. <strong>Post 
                meeting update. USA has confirmed it will host the next </strong>international 
              conference in the fall of 2007 or Spring 2008. </li>
            <li>It was suggested the conference be held in a prestigious international 
              location. A professional conference partner was suggested as essential.</li>
            <li> Members that do not have sponsorship restrictions should pursue sponsorship 
              to support USA; USA will aim to set up an appropriate account. The most 
              convenient way to set up a cash account is to find an appropriate conference 
              partner (equivalent to Spearhead plc in the UK).</li>
            <li> UK will pass residual funds from the 2005 Conference to USA when 
              conference account is set up. (Action Bud and Taf).</li>
            <li> UK will chair the Programme Committee, with input from Norway as 
              past chair.</li>
            <li> UK will weight the feedback from the 2005 Conference and pass on 
              to USA and Programme Committees.</li>
            <li> The 2005 Conference database to be transferred to USA.</li>
            <li> Feedback from IRF 2005 meeting to be fed back to International Conference 
              delegates via the IRF website with a view to promoting interest in the 
              2008 conference. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>15. USA &#8211; Future Awards scheme </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scheme will be carried forward and developed by the UK, awards to 
              be made every three years at the global conference. </li>
            <li>Scheme to be disseminated to industry by individual IRF members, depending 
              on country organisation, and also advertised on the IRF website. </li>
            <li>The scheme will allow both self-nominations subject to relevant IRF 
              country endorsement, and direct nominations from IRF members.</li>
            <li> Award nominations to be preferably evaluated by the IRF judging panel 
              at a face to face meeting, separate to, but possibly attached to, the 
              annual meeting. Judging panel should include people with knowledge of 
              all the nominations to ensure proper evaluation. This may require research 
              by an IRF member country if the nominated initiative or product is not 
              known to us.</li>
            <li> The degree to which the nominated initiative or product meets the 
              IRF key challenges is to be incorporated into the &#8216;significance&#8217; 
              rating of nominations.</li>
            <li> Subject to paragraph 5 above, the current scoring system was agreed 
              suitable for the next awards event.</li>
            <li> Timeline to be established by the UK, working back from the date 
              of the next global conference. </li>
            <li>Consideration to be given to the possibility of providing feedback 
              to unsuccessful nominations, perhaps by giving advice of assessment 
              criteria and judging.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>16. Review of meeting &amp; next meeting</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>UK will issue notes of 2005 meeting promptly and aim to send memory 
              sticks loaded with conference documents and country updates as soon 
              as practically possible.</li>
            <li> Replacing the formal country update presentations with papers had 
              worked well, and this will be carried forward to the next meeting.</li>
            <li> The 2006 meeting to be held in the Netherlands.</li>
            <li> The 2007 meeting will be hosted by Australia.</li>
            <li> A mini meeting to be organised to coincide with OTC 2006. </li>
