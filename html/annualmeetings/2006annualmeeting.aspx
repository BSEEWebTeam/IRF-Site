The options are a web-based database and a server based    database. The former is expensive and needs financial commitment from IRF    countries though the latter, while being cheaper, has its limitations. <br />

What can be done to    prevent this in the future? Recommentations and standards were amended, and    these were implemented in API guidelines for Jack-ups and moored MODUs which    will be used for the 2006 hurricane season. These are freely available from    the API website. The Metocean criteria for monitoring hurricanes was outdated    and have been updated. Anchor design and mooring constraints were updated,    that the wells must be secured prior to evacuation.<br />

                      The Board decided in    2005 to ask the Norwegian Regulators (PSA and NPD) to conduct an external    review of its practices and procedures in three areas: 1) safety; 2) resource    management; and 3) environmental protection. The Norwegian Regulators met    with the Board and its staff over 2 days in the fall of 2005; interviewed    Board staff, governments and industry in the winter of 2005; and, presented a    report in the spring of 2006.<br />

By understanding how    people behave in certain situations you can predict their behaviour and by    influencing the unconscious actions of people you can improve safe behaviour.    The workgroup uses four forces, taken from the Maslow theory, to analyse behaviour    of those working in the industry. By teaching people to pay equal attention    to all these forces, you can influence their ability for them to work in a    safe manner. An analysis scheme has been set up by the workgroup to improve    safe behaviour, which will be used during interviews in the coming year, and    the results will assist in setting up guidelines and plans. The project works    on a top-down basis as the behaviour of management has to be changed before    the behaviour of workers can be changed and on improving communications    between management and the workers.<br />

There    is a &lsquo;village&rsquo; culture amongst drilling contractors there, where contractors    are more aware of safety within their own immediate community than of safety    awareness as a whole. This village culture means that the contractors are    perhaps even more consistent and diligent in their safety awareness in their    immediate surrounding than those in the West. The IADC didn&rsquo;t feel there was    much value at the moment in changing the statistics method due to this    culture. The IRF members expressed the need for reliable statistics from the    IADC to gain the most from the IRF/IADC partnership in the long-term.    However, comparing statistics and gaining harmony in the interpretation of    LTI definitions before they enter the statistics is a difficult issue and    this was recognised. This harmony is needed before reliable statistics can be    gained.<br />

OGP has    the ambition of achieving this in the industry through the issuing of    recommended practices and the setting up of safety committees with the goal    of monitoring. This issue is an important one, as 60% of fatalities in the    industry are reported in this field. OGP has issued targets to reduce this. A    safety data task force has also been set up, which includes NSOAF    representatives, with the objective of reviewing the fatalities reported to    the OGP in 2005, identifying key learnings and producing a summary report.<br />
