          <p><strong>2. Performance Measures Project</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
              The goal of this project is to measure and compare offshore safety performance among IRF<br />
              participants by collecting and comparing incident data based on a common set of criteria.</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The Overview and Guidelines document is ready to be released</li>
          </ul>

            <li>The KP3 report has created more impact than any single inspection that took place over these three years, and created industry and political awareness of the problem. Installation integrity is currently the number-one topic for all oil companies.</li>
