        <h3><strong>Day 1 &ndash; Monday 14 September 2009</strong></h3>
        <h3>Session 1. Welcome, business matters and country updates</h3>
        <h4>1.1	Review of agenda</h4>
        <p>There were no comments to the proposed agenda.</p>
        <h4>1.2	Minutes from last annual meeting</h4>
        <p>The minutes from the 15th annual meeting in Sydney were endorsed.</p>
        <h4>1.3	Country update &ndash; USA</h4>
        <p>Incident data indicate a possible falling trend in fatalities and severe injuries. </p>
        <p>New finds in the Gulf of Mexico are now mainly at deep water. Finds are mostly oil, and the USA expects to see an increase in oil and a decrease in gas production in coming years. The exploration drilling activity is currently low.</p>
        <p>Opening new areas closer to Florida, California or Alaska are pending decisions of the states administrations.  The issue of <em>buffer</em> zones is currently being discussed. In Florida, these might possibly extend as far as 50 miles off the coast.</p>
        <h4>1.4	Country update &ndash; UK</h4>
        <p>2009 has been marked by the 20th anniversary of the Piper Alpha disaster. HSE/OSD has laid down significant work to comply with a ministerial direction to review the industry&rsquo;s response to the KP3 Report. The results of the review were launched in July 2009.</p>
        <p>The last year UK has seen two helicopter incidents in offshore service, one with loss of 16 people. </p>
        <p>The fatality/injury statistics show a continuing downward trend over the last years. There is also a positive trend with regard to HC releases, with one major and 16 significant releases last year.</p>
        <p>A down trend is observed on exploration activity due to the economic climate and maturing of assets. Under the Step Change initiative the industry has taken on a high profile safety leadership commitment to invest in safety during the down turn. This commitment encompasses improvement of asset integrity KPIs like safety critical maintenance backlog and outstanding actions following 3rd party verification of safety critical equipment.</p>
        <p>Health &amp; Safety Commission (HSC) has merged with Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE), leading to a new strategy for the UK&rsquo;s health &amp; safety system as a whole. Currently, Offshore Division (OSD) faces challenges on staffing due to retirements, recruitments and the recent closure of the London office. </p>
        <p>The scope of health &amp; safety legislation has been extended to include offshore wind farms and other structures outside territorial waters. A review of the whole offshore legislation has been started.</p>
        <p>Projects on corrosion management and verification are now coming to completion. There are running projects on contractor competence, offshore food safety and various activities under the Workforce Involvement Group. <br />
          A research programme has resulted in a guidance document on management of ageing infrastructure. OSD is in the process of developing an intervention programme on ageing for 2010 and beyond.</p>
        <p>An HSE/industry workshop on the use of KPIs in the offshore industry is being planned.</p>
        <p>OSD is in the process of developing an intervention programme on leadership and KPIs for 2010 and beyond.</p>
        <p>A new HSE offshore website has recently been launched.</p>
        <h4>1.5	Country update &ndash; Norway</h4>
        <p>Oil and gas remains Norway&rsquo;s largest industry, contributing 26 percent to the GNP and employing 130 000 of a 4,7 mill population. The production is 20 times the domestic consumption. The industry has a large impact on the national economy and the society in general. There is an ongoing public debate on opening of new areas, especially in northern areas.</p>
        <p>Amendments to the Framework Regulations, in force from 1 July, clarify when night work is allowed. In addition, the rules relating to ordinary working hours and off-duty periods have been aligned with the EU working time directive.  After lengthy discussions between involved ministries, new revised draft joint HSE regulations for the petroleum activities offshore and on land facilities were submitted for public consultation in August 2009. Revised regulations should be in place during the course of the year to enter into force 1 July 2010. </p>
        <p>PSA has initiated work to establish a strategy on how to continue as an efficient regulator in view of current changes and developments in the industry, with a 7-10 years perspective. </p>
        <p>PSA has arranged seven topical seminars since last IRF meeting, aiming to share knowledge and experience and to signal areas of concern where the industry is expected to take initiatives. The presentations given are published on the PSA Web site, but most are in Norwegian. </p>
        <p>Reference was made to presentation in course of this meeting, relating to investigations of serious incidents, and to the life boat issue. Reference was also given to the PSA website for continuous and extensive information, e.g. the annual publications.</p>
        <h4>1.6	Country update &ndash; The Netherlands</h4>
        <p>The Netherlands have established a national policy to reduce the administrative burden of statutory regulation for companies, among other things leading to legislative changes. The initiative implies a reduced number of civil servants and number of government agencies. SSM covers a wide range of regulatory responsibilities, and has recently been appointed authority for offshore wind mill parks. The Netherlands also see a geothermal exploration permit &ldquo;boom&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>LTIs on the Dutch continental shelf remains low but with a slow, stable decrease. Fatal/severe injuries show an equally slow downwards trend. Major and significant HC leakages remain stable. The number of oil spills &ndash; of more than 5 liters - is significantly down. </p>
        <p>SSM applies a risk classification based inspection plan. The 5 year programme and inspection plan for 2010 were presented.</p>
        <h4>1.7	Country update &ndash; Brazil</h4>
        <p>For the last two years, only onshore blocks have been awarded in Brazil. The Government has initiated work aiming to establish a new state company to manage licenses. This will imply a major change of the licensing model.</p>
        <p>ANP has focused on training of its staff with regard to competence pertaining to distant offshore fields including pipelines and FPSOs, as well as regulatory tools such as risk assessment, investigation techniques, etc.  Work is ongoing to develop technical rules under a new regulatory framework for offshore facilities. </p>
        <p>There are currently 175 production facilities, mostly FPSOs, and 90 drilling facilities on the Brazilian continental shelf. The number of incidents have been stable (combined offshore and onshore figures). Five people were killed when a helicopter carrying 20 people crashed offshore. Three incidents involving single fatalities have been investigated during the last year, two of which were related to lifting activities. The Government has presented an updated regulatory framework for incident communication and investigation (see later). ANP is in the process of issuing investigation guidelines.</p>
        <h4>1.8	Country update &ndash; Canada</h4>
        <p>Following lengthy work on developing a new regulatory approach for occupational H&amp;S, a renewed effort has been made to amend legislation to incorporate this issue. An extensive draft effort is underway, targeting promulgation in 2010.</p>
        <p>There has been a strong political influence for a frontier and offshore regulatory renewal initiative, within a partnership of federal, provincial and territorial governments and regulators. The objective is to modernize the regulatory regime using a hybrid approach that maximizes benefits from goal based, performance based and prescriptive regulatory styles. As the first step, Drilling and Production Regulations have been drafted, with a target to come into force January 1, 2010. Board guidance to these regulations is currently under preparation. The next step will be an amalga-mation/modernization of the full suite of regulations, building on the approach taken in the D&amp;P regulations. A consolidated version of current regulations has been prepared and a gap analysis completed. A contractor will now be secured to prepare draft regulation for consultation purposes (target 2010).</p>
        <p>On 1 June 2009, the Boards issued an updated revision of the incident/investigation guidelines. These have adopted IRF criteria for measuring and comparing offshore safety performance. </p>
        <p>The most significant incident last year, was the Cougar Helicopter Crash on 12 March, with 17 fatalities and one survivor. Reference is made to presentation later in this meeting.</p>
        <p>New offshore projects were presented with emphasis on special challenges, such as the sour gas of the Deep Panuke NG Project.</p>
        <h4>1.9	Country update &ndash; Australia</h4>
        <p>An overview of time allocation at NOPSA was presented, with breakdown on the various regulatory tasks. Inspections, SC assessments and incident/complaint investigation account for 70 per cent of the time.</p>
        <p>Since last IRF meeting, major investigations have been or are being carried out on the Montara hydrocarbon leak, loss of anchors on a pipeline vessel, a fatality during mooring line handling, a gas compressor fire and the Varanus Island pipeline rupture in 2008. </p>
        <p>Recent initiatives are the CEO Safety Leadership Forum with focus on competency, and issuing the first edition of annual offshore H&amp;S safety performance report. </p>
        <p>An independent review resulted in 20 recommendations to improve NOPSA&rsquo;s regulatory performance. </p>
        <p>An inquiry carried out by the Productivity Commission, as part of a remit to reduce the regulatory burden in the upstream petroleum sector, also concluded with a number of recommendations relevant to NOPSA, mainly related to framework issues. </p>
        <p>A recent inquiry on offshore petroleum safety regulation also addressed practice and effectiveness of NOPSA. Recommendations relate to stronger interaction with operators by way of guidance and advice, especially in safety case preparation, regulatory intervention based on structured risk assessment, and addressing safety culture issues through the safety case permissioning process. Another outcome was the proposal for an independent inquiry body to be set up. The Government is now amending the legislation to give power to the Minister to appoint a commissioner to undertake inquiries into significant offshore incidents. </p>
        <p>NOPSA&rsquo; presented its priorities for next year, which are industry safety leadership, asset integrity, emergency preparedness, and contractors&rsquo; activities.</p>
        <h3>Session 2	Updates on Working Groups / Projects</h3>
        <h4>2.1	Update on Performance Measures progress</h4>
        <p>The workgroup has been very productive and has made huge steps forward. </p>
        <p>All country profiles are now on the website (except New Zealand). The profiles were reviewed by all countries prior to posting at the IRF website.</p>
        <p>The 2007 data are finalized and posted on the website. All data submittals seem to be consistent with the guidelines agreed upon by the workgroup. All countries have reported their preliminary 2008 performance measure figures. A review will be conducted to ensure accuracy prior to posting on the website. The group will begin work on 2009 performance figures by March 2010.</p>
        <p>The workgroup has asked the annual meeting&rsquo;s approval to go forward with posting of pre 2007 data for countries that want this. The meeting discussed this issue and decided not to go forward with the pre 2007 figures.</p>
        <h4>2.2	Update on Lifting Project progress</h4>
        <p>The workgroup has produced lifting inspection templates for competency, maintenance, planning and control, and for man riding in the derrick. These templates with guidance have been posted on the IRF website.</p>
        <p>A recommended HTO-based investigation methodology for offshore lifting incidents has been worked out and guidance placed on the website.</p>
        <p>The workgroup has created a database to store this inspection and investigation data. The intention is that IRF members should add their data to the database and that the workgroup should review it periodically and publish trends, learnings, etc.</p>
        <p>Incident root cause data are grouped into different categories. These figures have been presented at international crane and lifting conferences. The two most significant categories are deficient competence/practical experience and deficient maintenance programmes. </p>
        <p>The group is of the opinion that these achievements provide useful tools for the industry to audit their performance, to help identify and reduce risk and to improve training programmes. They also enable regulators to identify new trends in the risk picture relating to lifting operations.</p>
        <p>However, to maximize the benefit, the database must be fully populated. The workgroup calls for a greater commitment from all countries to enter root cause data. Over the last year, 8 inspection and 25 investigation reports have been added to the database, mostly from NOPSA. Four member countries have so far not entered any reports. </p>
        <p>The workgroup will look into consistency in methodology for investigation as basis for the reporting.</p>
        <p>The workgroup proposed to the annual meeting to stop putting inspection data on the database, on the grounds that the added value is questionable and it is time consuming to convert the input to the required format. The meeting discussed this and decided to discontinue entering inspection data. The inspection templates can remain on the website.</p>
        <h4>2.3	Update on Asset Integrity Progress</h4>
        <p>An overview over the HSE KP3 programme that ran from 2004 to 2007 was presented. The report published in 2007 raised a range of significant issues, and had a strong influence on HSE&rsquo;s subsequent intervention activities and programmes. The industry as well as other bodies and parties were also challenged to address areas of concern.</p>
        <p>HSE was asked to do a review based on the programme results. The review was split in two: 1) Review of industry progress in addressing the issues raised in the original KP3 report focusing on asset integrity and SCEs and 2) Improvements in safety culture.</p>
        <p>All industry stakeholders were invited to participate, and a focused question set was worked out. Oil &amp;Gas UK undertook a comprehensive review of its members, including some inspections offshore by its own consultants. Other key stakeholders e.g. IADC and Offshore Contractors Association responded. The trade unions principally contributed via the Workforce Involvement Group. An independent market research was carried out by means of interviews with offshore workers at heliports; 3813 questionnaires were collected.</p>
        <p>HSE/OSD reviewed the industry&rsquo;s progress in the following key areas: Asset integrity/process safety, the Physical state of the plant, safety critical systems, leadership, the engineering function, learning and communication, safety culture, and workforce involvement in controlling major accident hazards.</p>
        <p>Oil &amp; Gas UK&rsquo;s submission was substantial and encompassed technical guidelines, workshops, initiatives relating to skills and training, and the introduction of two new cross-industry KPIs. O&amp;GUK also provided their own analysis of the industry&rsquo;s addressing of the original KP3 &rdquo;traffic lights&rdquo; and found very significant improvements, with few &ldquo;red lights&rdquo; remaining.</p>
        <p>The review concluded that significant changes/improvements had been made in the overall field of asset integrity management since KP3, yet more is required. Possible complacency and reduction in asset maintenance due to economic climate are potential challenges.</p>
        <p>A repeat of the review in two years time in a similar way will be considered, based on industry self-reporting and regulator validation.</p>
        <h4>2.4	Update on Common Themes in Incident Causation</h4>
        <p>As an action point of the last IRF annual meeting, each country should identify incident causation themes that recur in their own incident investigations. The objective is to determine what are the similarities worldwide and if there are any common themes evident.</p>
        <p>Data have been supplied in varying forms; by causes, grouped, or as table/text. Procedures and training appear as common causes across the different jurisdictions and across all types of incidents, however, the present data are insufficient for full comparison. </p>
        <p>The member countries have differing levels of incident investigation and apply different systems to identify causes. Norway has noted that operator and regulator investigations of the same incident seldom identify the same underlying triggers/root cause, in that the operators tend to focus on immediate causes rather than root causes.</p>
        <p>As a first step towards a possible common methodology for incident causation analysis, IRF should agree on a list of cause categories.</p>
        <h4>2.5	Update on NSOAF Working Groups</h4>
        <p>There are currently five active working groups within the North Sea Offshore Authorities Forum (NSOAF):</p>
        <p><strong>HS&amp;E group: </strong>Discusses questions relating to harmonization, reducing industry burdens of authority intervention, supervision, lifting equipment, asset integrity, capacity and competence of organizations, HS&amp;E leading and lagging key performance indicators, lateral learning amongst regulators, and organizing NSOAF safety coneferences. This group is chaired by UK.</p>
        <p><strong>EU activities: </strong>A new group established in 2008, chaired by Norway. The group digests ideas coming up in the EU that may impact regulatory work in the NSOAF member countries. Information and views are exchanged with a view to possible implementation of EU directives and initiatives in a harmonized manner.  A project within this group aims at gathering experience and establishing routines for market surveillance, e.g. relating to offshore cranes</p>
        <p><strong>Drilling/wells group:</strong> Leadership in this group is changed from Norway to the Netherlands. The group deals with well related issues, aiming to influence the industry commonly and in each country. </p>
        <p><strong>CCS group: </strong>A new working group established in 2008, chaired by UK. The objective is to share and consolidate information about safety issues related to carbon capturing and storage. The group had its first meeting in Copenhagen mid September 2009. </p>
        <p><strong>Training:</strong> Having finished harmonization of basic training requirements, the working group has new work areas under consideration. A decision about possible continued work will be made next year.</p>
        <h4>2.6	Outcome of NSOAF multi-national audit: Supervision</h4>
        <p>This audit started fall 2007 and finished June 2009. The objective was to persuade the E&amp;P industry of the necessity to improve supervision as a crucial aspect in the risk management process, improve effectiveness of supervisory roles and responsibilities, involvement of senior management in the safety management system. It was also an objective to share the audit outcome with the North-West European and global E&amp;P offshore industry trade associations and with IRF.</p>
        <p>The audit covered a wide range of aspects relating to efficiency and quality of the supervisory functions, also at contractor companies. The findings from the audit were presented. For further details, the complete audit report can be found at: <br />
          <a href="http://www.sodm.nl/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_85A2472099B5013B3D679CE8B2F7459541D20C00">http://www.sodm.nl/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_85A2472099B5013B3D679CE8B2F7459541D20C00 </a></p>
        <p>The audit was followed up by a letter to all operators and trade associations with the report attached including statements about main improvement points. The findings have been promulgated at various offshore workforce events, and the theme &lsquo;Supervision&rsquo; will be addressed in the NSOAF conference in Aberdeen in April 2010. The industry has committed to work out a toolkit for worksite visits.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the objectives of the audit terms of reference were accomplished. The recommended follow-up initiatives are judged as good incentives for the European offshore industry to improve the effectiveness of supervision.</p>
        <h4>2.7	Update on CCS projects in the Netherlands</h4>
        <p>The Dutch mining legislation provides basic framework for storage of CH4, CO2, N2, etc., but no rules exist on issues like access to transport and storage of CO2, long term stewardship of storage sites and the financial arrangements for long term monitoring. The Netherlands is in the process of implementing a new EU directive and OSPAR guidelines on CCS.</p>
        <p>Many gas fields in the Netherlands are technically suitable for storage. One is a field below Barendrecht (near the city of Rotterdam); this has caused a considerable public opposition. There is also potential for CO2 storage in gas fields on the Dutch continental shelf when the fields become depleted. These fields could store greenhouse gas emissions equal to 13 years of the current largest industrial point sources.</p>
        <p>Main concerns are well integrity issues, assessment of reservoir and cap rock characteristics and monitoring &ldquo;for ever&rdquo;. </p>
        <p>SSM messages are that CO2 storage requires individual site studies. CO2 is not the usual E&amp;P activity, but the E&amp;P industry has the technical and scientific basis and best practice to make a significant contribution. Empty gas reservoirs have by nature a proven seal for CH4, as opposed to e.g. aquifers.</p>
        <h4>2.8	Update on &ldquo;Idle Iron&rdquo;</h4>
        <p>The GOMR Idle Iron Plan is carried out in three steps:</p>
        <p>As the first step MMS has started enforcing the plugging and abandonment of wells inactive for more than 5 years and with a potential for mudslide. This applies to 21 operators with 515 wells.</p>
        <p>As the second step MMS is now tracking platforms and facilities that have a surface location on expired and terminated leases. The operators have been notified of their obligation to remove these platforms within one year after the lease terminates. This applies to 61 operators and 227 platforms. Criteria that may justify a time extension on terminated leases have been worked out.</p>
        <p>The &ldquo;800 lb gorilla&rdquo; will be the third step, which implies addressing 4937 completed wells and 483 structures that have been idle for more than 5 years. This involves 109 operators with 35 per cent of all abandoned wells.<br />
          Offshore work to comply was postponed due to last year&rsquo;s hurricanes. MMS used the delay to meet with industry to determine a way to secure idle wells more quickly.</p>
        <p>MMS decided to issue a Notice to Lessees (NTL) that defines terms such as &ldquo;no longer useful for operations&rdquo;, &ldquo;paying quantities&rdquo; and &ldquo;downhole zonal isolation&rdquo; in order to clarify regulatory requirements and expectations. The NTL also apply to idle platforms and pipelines.</p>
        <p>Full compliance implies a massive amount of work. Equipment will be available after finishing work resulting from the hurricanes.</p>
        <h4>2.9	Update on ICRARD matters</h4>
        <p>The ICRARD website provides a bespoke search engine for all participating countries&rsquo; offshore research databases and a list of key national contacts for offshore research topics.</p>
        <p>The committee meets annually, this year in St. Johns 6 -7 August. The usage of the website was reviewed. The member countries&rsquo; current research activities were presented and research on specific topics was reviewed. Topics at this year&rsquo;s meeting were ageing, freefall lifeboats and escape/evacuation.</p>
        <p>The ICRARD website is probably an under-used facility. There seems to be a need to publicise it both internally within our organisations, and externally, for which a &ldquo;flier&rdquo; is available. Each member is asked to post news items on the website, ideally 6 each per year.</p>
        <p>Next ICRARD committee meeting will be in UK autumn 2010.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>Day 2 &ndash; Tuesday 15 September 2009</strong></h3>
        <h3>Session 3	Operational, technical and regulatory matters/issues </h3>
        <h4>3.1	On the Norwegian projects on free-fall and conventional lifeboats and ensuring the effectiveness of the total system for launching lifeboats</h4>
        <p>Problems were first detected in 2005, when damages and deflections of the superstructure occurred during test launch of free-fall lifeboats. The Oil Industry Association (OLF) initiated its lifeboat project the same year, focusing on superstructure strength, G-forces and dynamic response. In the course of this project, new problems were detected, partly by practical experience and partly as spin-offs of the project. Phase 2 of this project, which started in 2007, therefore extended the scope to encompass a number of issues such as launching arrangements, navigation and evacuation of injured persons. As part of this project phase a new standard for free-fall life boats was developed. Further details can be found at the OLF website on page <a href="http://www.olf.no/lifeboatreports/">http://www.olf.no/lifeboatreports/</a> .</p>
        <p>Another lifeboat project was initiated by the Norwegian Shipowners&rsquo; Association (NSA) in 2008. This project focused mainly on maintenance, training and competency, design verification and evacuation philosophy.</p>
        <p>There is still possibly remaining work relating to some uncertainties. Some of these concerns also apply to conventional lifeboats, MOB/FRC boats and life rafts. </p>
        <h4>3.2	On the background for and how NOPSA acquired its ISO 9001 certification</h4>
        <p>Process development in NOPSA has been characterized by short lead times and with &ldquo;style&rdquo; differences, but still in a broadly consistent manner. </p>
        <p>ISO 9001 was chosen as an international recognized model and as a proven framework for continuous improvement, for instance as a cornerstone for recent development at Fremantle Ports, where substantial improvements have been achieved. With the introduction of ISO 9001 NOPSA aimed at providing assurance to stakeholders that the system for managing risks is in place and effective, to validate the management system completeness and effectiveness, and thereby enhance the reputation of the agency. </p>
        <p>Prior to seeking certification, internal audits of all processes were conducted. Time was allocated to enable improvements to be made as a result of these audits, including training of personnel. ISO certification was then achieved on first attempt and with no deficiency findings.</p>
        <p>NOPSA is now in the process of embedding the processes in everyday work. This implies turning the processes into risk mitigation measures to ensure that risk controls are embedded and managed as part of daily work routines and that key process controls are in place and are effective. All processes should be integrated and harmonized to ensure the integrity and quality of the agency&rsquo;s work. Efforts are made to capture and embed learning by streamlining the improvement feedback loop.</p>
        <h4>3.3	On the HSE Healthy Working Lives Gold Award</h4>
        <p>The Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives (SCHWL) is an advisory body that visits onshore workplaces on request, funded by the Scottish Government. The body has established an award programme where organizations can work up through three levels of Award, from Bronze and Silver, and on to Gold. The gold level looks at strategic issues in addition to the status elements required for the bronze and silver level. Details about the award programme and the award criteria can be found at the SCHWL website at <a href="http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/award/criteria.aspx">http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/award/criteria.aspx</a> . </p>
        <h4>3.4	On Norway&rsquo;s approach to achieving Zero Discharge</h4>
        <p>The general zero discharge requirement on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) is a precautionary target related to operational discharges under normal operations. It was introduced in 1997 with a set target for compliance 1.1.2006. The requirements concerns both naturally existing as well as added environmental dangerous substances. </p>
        <p>Chemicals are classified in four categories as green, yellow, red and black. &ldquo;Black&rdquo; chemicals are prohibited while a lot of work is done to substitute &ldquo;red&rdquo; chemicals. Because &ldquo;black&rdquo; and &ldquo;red&rdquo; chemicals to a large extent have been substituted by less harmful substances, the categories yellow and green have been stable or increased slightly over the last ten years.  The categorization of chemicals can be found in the Norwegian Activity Regulations section 56b.</p>
        <p>For the Barents Sea and the areas outside Lofoten, additional requirements apply since 2005. These imply zero discharge of drilling fluid and drilling cuttings except from the top hole (under certain conditions), meaning that such materials need to be injected or transported to onshore for handling. Furthermore, discharge of produced water and discharge to sea of substances from well testing is not permitted. </p>
        <p>Due to increased technical complexity etc., the zero discharge requirement may have potentially negative consequences for safety and working environment. These must be identified and handled.</p>
        <p>The regulations clearly state that non-conformity with discharge permits may be allowed in acute circumstances if deemed necessary from a safety point of view.</p>
        <p>The focusing on and better understanding of the consequences of discharges to the environment has led to better planning, development of new methods and equipment. Reducing the number of chemicals that can harm the environment also combine very well with the efforts to reduce exposure to chemical agents of offshore workers.</p>
        <h4>3.5	On Arctic Issues</h4>
        <p>There is a marked public opposition to oil and gas activities in the Arctic, among other things with a concern for safe habitat of the bowhead whale. Particular arctic issues of statutory concern are therefore issues like oil spill response in ice, blow-out response including relief well capability, arctic design standards, ice scour and activity induced noise. Issues relating to natural gas transportation, such as pipeline protection/burial/leak detection are of special concern in arctic waters.</p>
        <p>Facts about the Liberty project, which is located in federal waters offshore north Alaska were presented.</p>
        <h4>3.6	Effective engagement of stakeholders</h4>
        <p>The members gave brief accounts of their practices in approaches to manage liaison/engagement/intervention with operators and other stakeholders.</p>
        <p>In the following debate, the question about how to separate the coaching role from the authority role was discussed. Among the comments, the need to apply different approaches depending on the experience with the various operators was mentioned. Another viewpoint was the need for consistency in inspection, for instance by rotating inspectors in order to avoid inspectors becoming &ldquo;captured&rdquo; by the projects. First of all it is supported that the regulator&rsquo;s role must be clearly communicated, externally and internally.</p>
        <p>Some member countries have established stakeholder surveys as a successful means of collecting feed-back that may contribute to shape the direction of the regulatory activities. </p>
        <h3>Session 4	Major Incidents and Investigations</h3>
        <h4>4.1	Updates on the Montara incident, Varanus Island explosion  and fire, and the fatal accident on the Karratha Spirit facility investigations, including the recent inquiries into the Australian regulatory regime and NOPSA&rsquo;s effectiveness</h4>
        <p><strong>Varanus Island</strong><br />
          Nobody was injured in this incident, which caused a 30 per cent drop in domestic gas supply  for 3 months and an industry cost of 2-6 billion AU$. The immediate cause of the explosion and fire was a pipeline rupture due to reduced wall thickness. The investigation to date identified root causes of ineffective anti-corrosion coating, ineffective cathodic protection and ineffective inspection and monitoring. </p>
        <p><strong>FSO Karratha Spirit</strong><br />
          A deck hand was killed when the vessel was disconnecting from the loading buoy due to approaching cyclone. This is the first offshore petroleum fatality in five years.  Investigation report has been forwarded to the Department for Public Prosecutions. It appears that a sequence of unwanted events prior to the accident were contributory factors. </p>
        <p><strong>Castoro Otto pipelay vessel</strong><br />
          An incident with a serious potential occurred when the crew on board the pipelay vessel Castoro Otto failed to recover the anchors when a cyclone approached in the Timor Sea. The incident prompted NOPSA to issue a safety alert warning operators to consider location specific cyclone scenarios in their Cyclone Response Procedure (CRP).</p>
        <p>The Timor Sea is known as the cyclone &ldquo;nursery&rdquo;, where cyclones develop rapidly from tropical low pressure systems.  For facilities in this area, the CRP must identify and address such situations.</p>
        <p>Both the Karratha Spirit and the Castoro Otto incidents drew attention to regulatory interfaces between NOPSA and other agencies. The Varanus Island investigation also recommended legislative amendments and increased cooperation between Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and NOPSA. </p>
        <p><strong>Montara field blow-out</strong><br />
          A crew of 65 were safely evacuated when the blow-out situation occurred. The leak is still unabated, causing increasing environmental concerns. NOPSA has issued notices to reduce risk in recovery operations, e.g. to prohibit people going back on the platform, and has accepted a revised safety case to drill relief well. NOPSA investigation is currently collating documentation &amp; taking witness statements, and will examine root causes and determine possible legal breaches. Investigation at site will start when this is safe.</p>
        <h4>4.2	Updates on investigations of serious incidents in Norway. Including the fatal accident on the Oseberg B installation</h4>
        <p><strong>Lifting incident at Troll C</strong><br />
          During unloading a supply vessel with an offshore crane, a deck hand was squeezed between a container hanging in the hook of the offshore crane and a row of containers on the cargo deck. He suffered serious injuries, and the incident could under marginally changed circumstances have been fatal. Unsafe behavior is one of the underlying causes for the incident, but the circumstances also raised issues relating to management, work planning and reporting culture.</p>
        <p><strong>Falling object on semi-sub Deep Sea Atlantic</strong><br />
          A 30&rsquo;&rsquo; conductor fell out of the manual side door elevator hitting the &rdquo;gorilla arm&rdquo; before sliding down the catwalk machine. The conductor weighs about 7 tons and is 12.8 meters long. Nobody was injured, but a serious accident potential is obvious. The incident is identical to an incident on West Epsilon in 2007, thus again drawing the attention to the issue of learning. IADC has reported several similar incidents with manual side door elevators.</p>
        <p><strong>Oseberg B fatal accident</strong><br />
          During dismantling of scaffolding, unfortunate actions made a scaffolder fall 14 meters to the deck below. He was transported to hospital in Bergen, where he died. The investigation revealed deficiencies in governing documents relating to this type of activity, risk assessment, planning, competence, and clarification of roles and supervisory duties.</p>
        <p><strong>Collision between vessel and installation at the Ekofisk field</strong><br />
          The supply vessel <em>Big Orange XVIII</em> collided on 8 June with a water injection installation at the Ekofisk complex, causing substantial material damage both to the installation and the vessel. Nobody was injured on the vessel or on the installation, but the potential for a major accident is evident. It appears that the officer in charge was distracted by a phone call and failed to deactivate the autopilot before entering the 500 meter zone. Hence, attempted changes of the sailing course were not carried out as expected by the officer on the bridge. Also in this case, poor learning from similar incidents was observed. Other observations are poor surveillance of vessels movements and execution of responsibility duties.</p>
        <h4>4.3	Updates on a serious incident in Brazil</h4>
        <p>A worker died on Petrobras&rsquo; FPSO P-34 on 4 January 2009 in an accident at the Jubarte field in the Campos basin.  A faulty block valve caused oil and water to gush out at high pressure. Two other workers suffered minor injuries</p>
        <p>ANP gave a detailed account of the course of events. It appears as if root causes were deficient planning of work and in communication between shifts.</p>
        <h4>4.4	General discussion on Lessons for Regulators in Using Industry Health &amp; Safety Incident data to drive Industry Health &amp; Safety Performance Improvement</h4>
        <p><strong>Australia</strong><br />
          Incident data are submitted as individual incident reports and a  summary monthly report. In addition, NOPSA collects data via inspection activities.  The data are shared with the industry by means of NOPSA Health and Safety Performance Report, quarterly KPIs available on the website and promoted in the CEO monthly newsletters. Data sharing also takes place through the National Programmes, in presentation to conferences and industry fora, as well as in operator liaison meetings. The Offshore Health and Safety Performance Report is published annually and contains analyses of incidents. This year&rsquo;s report concludes that common causes of incidents are preventative maintenance needing improvement, procedures not used or followed, and design specifications needing improvement.</p>
        <p><strong>Norway</strong><br />
          A comprehensive dataset is collected as part of the scheme &ldquo;Trends in risk levels&rdquo;. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are worked out on basis of this dataset. Anonymized data are readily available for industry and research institutions, and the analyses are published in an annual report. This dataset enables PSA to establish an independent assessment of trends in risk level on an industry level. The results play an important part of the tripartite collaboration and also add value to the different corporate indicator systems. The PSA make use of the results in prioritizing the regulatory activities and in execution of its advisory role to the Ministry. The successful HC leak reduction project was referred to as an example on how data can be used to challenge and motivate industry for improvement.</p>
        <p><strong>Canada</strong><br />
          CNLOPB collects statistical data from incident reporting. Statistical data encompass data like worked hours, reportable injuries, medical aid injuries and first aid incidents. Incident reporting encompasses fatalities/missing persons, fire/explosions, significant damage and other events of safety significance. Investigation reports by the companies are an important data source. CNLOPB has observed that there seems to lesser quality of investigations by drilling contractors as compared with operators.</p>
        <p><strong>The Netherlands</strong><br />
          SSM inspection projects results are presented to the Netherlands Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Association (NOGEPA) committees in order to achieve commitment for follow-up initiatives. Experience and data are also shared with the industry in forums like the joint SSM/NOGEPA workgroup &lsquo;Safety Behavior&rsquo;, the NOGEPA Maintenance Working Group and the NOGEPA OIM day. SSM inspection project results have also led to the establishment of NOGEPA Working Group &lsquo;Gas Leakages&rsquo;. The elimination of the non-fail-safe link tilt system on MODUs is another example. In general, a message from SSM based on collected incident data is that the risk connected with routine activities should not be underestimated. Furthermore, the industry should improve the use of task risk assessments, supervision and safety behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>UK</strong><br />
          HSE uses incident data reporting among other things to decide immediate action. Data are also used to identify weak points, i.e. at specific operators. Incident statistics are being used to set agreed targets, e.g. for HC leakages. HSE provides data on quarterly basis to the industry and expects the industry to come up with solutions. The industry is also expected to set their own targets based on KPIs. </p>
        <p><strong>USA</strong><br />
          MMS has seen an increased amount of reported incidents following new reporting rules. This has resulted in an increased number of investigations, more safety alerts, and an improved basis for selecting areas to concentrate on during inspections. MMS assumes that this has been a contribution to performance improvement.</p>
        <h3>Session 5	Debate on transportation of offshore workers</h3>
        <h4>5.1	On the Cougar Helicopter Sikorsky S92-A flight 491 crash and the Newfoundland public inquiry into matters respecting helicopter passenger safety for workers</h4>
        <p>CNLOPB informed about details of the flight. The craft lost oil pressure in the gear box due to failure of an oil filter stud, and lost drive of the tail rotor at 500 m height. The craft hit the sea surface with estimated G-forces in excess of 20. Miraculously, there was one survivor, suffering bad hypothermia and a spinal injury. Cougar flights were suspended for two weeks during investigation of causes. A standby helicopter is now in place at St. Johns in order to reduce the response time at such incidents. Work is ongoing to look at the adequacy of helicopter suits. Other measures are in-water training for offshore personnel and improved safety briefing at heliport.</p>
        <p>Address to inquiry website: <a href="http://www.oshsi.nl.ca">www.oshsi.nl.ca</a>.</p>
        <h4>5.2	UK update on the two recent helicopter incidents on the UKCS and their resulting reviews/action</h4>
        <p>On 18th February a Super Puma crashed about 500 metres south of the ETAP platform in the North Sea Central Area. Of 18 people on board, only 3 suffered minor injuries when the craft landed heavily on sea. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) commenced investigation the following day. The preliminary examination revealed no evidence of any pre-impact malfunction of any major mechanical components. The visibility was poor at the time of the incident.</p>
        <p>Since the accident, the operator has amended the procedures for offshore night operations. Among other issues, the examination has drawn the attention to the use of personal location beacons (PLBs) worn by the passengers. These apparently caused the &lsquo;smart&rsquo; long-range beacons on the emergency life rafts to shut down, because they are designed to do so if they detect another beacon signal within a certain radius, in order to preserve battery capacity and avoid signal confusion. As an immediate action all PLBs carried by passengers on offshore helicopter flights are withdrawn from service. Smart beacons in life rafts are to be replaced by non-smart beacons by end of 2009, and PLBs will be reintroduced once all technical hurdles have been overcome.</p>
        <p>All 16 on board lost their lives when another Super Puma ditched on 1st April 2009 during return from an oil platform situated approximately 145 nm north-east of Aberdeen. The AAIB investigation concluded that failure within the epicyclic reduction gearbox module of the main rotor gearbox resulted in the rupture of the gearbox case, causing the main rotor head to separate from the helicopter. The investigation report contains recommendations requiring action by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) relating to analysis and review of the design, operational life and inspection processes of the planet gears used in the epicyclic module of the main rotor gearbox. </p>
        <p>Further information about the accidents and follow-up activities can be found at <a href="http://www.oilandgas.org.uk">www.oilandgas.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.aaib.gov.uk">www.aaib.gov.uk</a> .</p>
        <h4>5.3	Norway helicopter incidents and initiated reviews/action</h4>
        <p>In a short period of time during Easter week 2009, Norway saw three helicopter incidents on the NCS, where helicopters were forced to return to shore or to land on nearest platform. Lack of or insufficient information to offshore workers and their families generated rumors and speculations leading to worries and mistrust to helicopters as a safe means of transportation offshore. </p>
        <p>The last serious accident on NCS happened in 1997 with 12 fatalities, after which two committees were appointed by the Ministry of Transport. A number of risk reducing measures were identified, relating to technical and operational issues, authority responsibility, air traffic control and international cooperation. A tripartite committee for helicopter safety on the NCS was also established. Among its tasks is to follow up the implementation of risk reducing measures and to be a forum for more general discussions on helicopter safety.</p>
        <p>The way forward seems to imply new types of helicopters, improved conditions of monitoring system, compulsory anti-collision systems, anti-icing protection, simulator training, improved radar coverage, improved weather forecast, better helideck monitoring systems on MOUs, etc. </p>
        <h4>5.4	Australia helicopter incidents and initiated reviews/action</h4>
        <p>Australia has not had any serious incidents in the offshore petroleum activities, but are facing the same challenges with regard to interface with various involved bodies as mentioned by e.g. HSE.</p>
        <h4>5.5	General debate on helicopter transportation</h4>
        <p>It was agreed that the offshore safety regulators&rsquo; role mainly relates to the workforce&rsquo;s and families&rsquo; confidence of helicopter as a safe means of transportation. Among other issues discussed was whether regulators should look into contracts between operators and helicopter contractors, with a view to assess their incentives for improvement. Another issue raised was how to share all available information, which may cause worries if not done in an appropriate manner. On the other hand, confidence of users and their relatives rely heavily on information about facts like what happened, what went wrong and what have been done to improve. It was agreed that CNLOPB will work out a draft matrix for regulatory requirements/concerns relating to helicopter transportation and circulate to the members to fill in for each country. </p>
        <p>CNSOPB also informed about a review of emergency breathing apparatus in use in various jurisdictions. The review will be circulated among the IRF members.</p>
        <h3>Session 6	Any other business</h3>
        <h4>6.1	On GPS monitoring of rig locations after hurricane evacuations</h4>
        <p>MMS informed about a recently issued Notice to Lessees (NTL) which requires operators to outfit all MODUs that are moored, including jack-up rigs, with multiple GPS transponders that are installed and operational by July 1st, 2009 (start of hurricane season).  Such transponders should be capable of transmitting data for at least seven days after a storm has passed. The operator is required to provide the MMS GOMR office with access to real-time GPS location data and notify the MMS Continuity of operations plan office should a MODU move off location during a storm. The MMS will use the drift path data to identify platforms and pipelines that might have been damaged by a drifting rig as well as to locate the rig.</p>
        <h4>6.2	On Brazil&rsquo;s new regulatory framework for incident communication and investigation</h4>
        <p>ANP gave an account of which types of incidents by requirements of the law should be immediately reported to them. The concessionaire is required to investigate and within 30 days provide ANP with a detailed incident report. Failure to do so is subject to penalties.</p>
        <p>ANP also accounted for their detailed procedure for their own investigation in case there has been an incident of loss of stability or positioning, fire, explosion, collision, fatality due to an operational incident or spills of more than 8 m3.</p>
        <h4>6.3	Last Minute Issues</h4>
        <p>In this debate, most issues were of informative character, which required no decisions or action.</p>
        <p>However, most members had received OGP&rsquo;s report: &ldquo;Regulators&rsquo; use of Standards&rdquo; and had been asked for a final review. Some members could not recall having had received the report.</p>
        <h3>Session 7	International Regulators&rsquo; Offshore Safety Conference in Vancouver, Canada, October 2010 </h3>
        <h4>7.1	Review/discussion of Draft Programme</h4>
        <p>The draft programme was reviewed and chairs for the different sessions assigned. The status on invitation of speakers etc. was reviewed. MMS will follow up the various commitments among the members in this respect. Deadline for feed-back on confirmed speakers was set to 1st October.</p>
        <p>It was discussed to broaden the scope on day 2 to encompass other KPIs than incident data, for instance whether OGP should present from their side. It was agreed that comparison with OGP KPIs should better be incorporated into the IRF presentation.</p>
        <h4>7.2	Review/discussion of conference venue and arrangements </h4>
        <p>It was decided that the next annual IRF meeting will take place in continuation of the conference on Thursday 21th October.</p>
        <p>The registration fee for the conference attendees will be about 700$. </p>
        <p>A dedicated conference web site will be prepared.</p>
        <p>The event organizer has been asked to include info about &ldquo;things to do&rdquo; in the brochure.</p>
        <h4>7.3	Update on Carolita Kallaur Award Arrangements</h4>
        <p>The members should pre-sift received nominations prior to submission to the IRF Assessment Panel. Submission of nominees by 1 June 2010. The IRF Assessment Panel, chaired by the Netherlands, undertakes the assessment during the period 1 June &ndash; 15 July 2010. Draft detailed plan of action will be distributed to members in January 2010 by the Netherlands. The CK cover letter together with IRF Safety Conference details will be updated and distributed / published on the IRF Web in February 2010.</p>
        <h3>Session 8	Forum matters and summing up </h3>
        <h4>8.1	Debate on forum matters</h4>
        <p>It was generally agreed that the forum is functioning well and that there is no need for changes.</p>
        <p>On the issue of establishing possible regional group, it was agreed that the Vancouver conference as well as the next SPE conference in Rio in April are good opportunities to establish contacts with this in mind. The issue of regional groups could also be brought up as a discussion item at the Vancouver conference.</p>
        <p>The option of establishing an IRF intranet site was discussed. It was agreed that &ndash; being such a small group - we can at the moment manage with e-mails and other means of contact. </p>
        <p>Members were informed that the HSE&rsquo;s responsibility of hosting the IRF website is nearing an end and invited therefore another member to carry the can. </p>
        <p>It was agreed that the IRF 2010 Annual Meeting will take place in Vancouver, BC, immediately following the conference, on Thursday 21th October 2010. The hosts will of course be CNLOPB/CNSOPB.</p>
        <p>ANP accepted to host the 2011 IRF Annual meeting.</p>
        <h4>8.2	Agreeing on the 16th Annual Meeting outcomes, commitments and action points</h4>
        <p>The action points that came out of the discussions were reviewed and agreed upon.</p>
