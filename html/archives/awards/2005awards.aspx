          <h3>NOBLE DRILLING</h3>
          <p>Harmonising safety cases has been an objective of the NSOAF for some time. The idea originated in the Netherlands in the early nineties  from discussions SSM inspectors had with drilling contractors at the time that  safety case regime was introduced. However, not much progress was made until  the late nineties. Not until someone was found who would champion the  initiative. That is where Noble Drilling came in. </p>
            <p>During 1997 Noble Drilling was the only drilling contractor  active in four different North Sea coastal states and therefore Noble Drilling  was selected by the NSOAF to undergo the first multi-national audit which  focused on their HSE management system. During this period Noble Drilling was involved in a process  of changing and upgrading its management system. From this audit it became  clear that not only one common management system, but also one standard safety  case (instead of a different one per coastal state) would contribute to  improving the safety and health performance. Stimulated by the multinational  audit process Noble Drilling submitted during 1998 and 1999 the same HSE cases  (documents) in Denmark and the Netherlands, building on the UK Safety Case.  Noble Drilling Netherlands management was instrumental in this initiative. A  number of in depth reviews with the regulators were conducted and it became  obvious that a harmonised HSE case approach would make the risk assessment  process and supervision by the regulators much more transparent for all parties  involved. </p>
            <p>Through IADC and NSOAF meetings it became clear that within  the North Sea chapter other drilling contractors were thinking along the same  lines. It was agreed to develop a North West European HSE case guidelines. The  IADC made funds available for expert support and Noble Drilling Netherlands BV  volunteered to act as a project champion. In close liaison with the NSOAF a  template, based on the Noble Drilling HSE cases, was developed. Early 2003 the  NSOAF accepted the North West European HSE case guidelines for MODU&rsquo;s.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>This excellent initiative has  great potential for contributing to improve the safety and health of offshore  operations in other regions of the world. As a matter of fact, during a meeting  in May 2004 in Dubrovnic between European Regulators and Drilling Contractors  is was agreed to develop the template further in order for it to be used for  land operations and operations around the world. IADC has made a commitment to  lead this. Soon it will be possible to download these guidelines from the IADC  website <a href="http://www.iadc.org/">www.iadc.org</a>.&nbsp; You will be able to get a copy of the 3rd  revision of these guidelines with one of the IADC representative who are attending  this conference today and tomorrow.</p>
            <h3 align="left">STEP  CHANGE IN SAFETY</h3>
            Step  Change in Safety, the oldest organisation of its kind, began in 1997 as a  collaboration of industry leaders connected with the UK offshore oil and gas  industry. Its aim is to work in partnership to share safety information and  good practice and to secure a step change in UK&rsquo;s offshore safety performance.  It has forged strong links with all UK upstream oil and gas stakeholders  uniting senior managers of oil companies, contractors, suppliers, Trades Union  and relevant government departments.Step  Change has four workforce networks that target UKCS companies from factory  floor to senior management. Through these networks the Step Change Leadership  Team keeps abreast of safety issues and directs workgroups to solve key  problems and develop guidance to improve safety performance.In  terms if its achievements, Step Change has raised consciousness that safety is  integral to best sustainable economic performance. It has contributed to  lasting reductions in accidents and unsafe incidents and shares incident data  far exceeing statutory reporting requirements. Lots of products have been  created e.g. good practice booklets, an interactive web site and safety alert  database, an offshore passport, videos and CDs covering issues as diverse as  safety observational systems, lifting and mechanical handling, lessons learned  from 11North Sea fatalities, and common permit to work system.In  collaboration with HSE, StepChange has secured from the UK Government and Industry  sustainability forum (known as PILOT) a commitment for the UK to become the  safest offshore sector in the world by 2010. It has set a powerful agenda for  all stakeholder companies to target asset integrity, safety culture, and hazard  management.
            <p>In  terms of its impact elsewhere, Step Change products have been exported  world-wide and are translated into a number of different languages including  Russian and Chinese. The British Standards Institute has incorporated elements  of Step Change guidance into its own standards. Step Change has presented to  offshore communities as far apart as Australia, the USA, and the West Indies.  The web site is used by many organisations from more than 100 countries: 25% of  the registered users are from outside the UK.</p>
            <p>The  Carolita Kallaur Award for outstanding international safety leadership is  presented to &ldquo;Step Change in Safety&rdquo; by the International Regulators Forum. </p>
            <p>The  award recognises the impact Step Change has made in the UK in raising awareness  of safety as an key driver for best sustainable business performance, and in  securing long term reductions in injury rates and near miss incidents.</p>
            <p>The  award also recognises that Step Change&rsquo;s guidance booklets and web sites have  gained world-wide interest and influence. &nbsp;&nbsp;For more information about Step Change in Safety see website : <a href="http://stepchangeinsafety.net/stepchange/">http://stepchangeinsafety.net/stepchange/</a> </p>
            <h3 align="left">WORKING TOGETHER FOR SAFETY </h3>
            <p>The Norwegian project &ldquo;Working  Together for Safety&rdquo; was established in January 2001 as a step to improve the  safety in human conduct on board vessels and installations in the offshore  petroleum industry, and to direct attention to all issues that influence on the  character of offshore work and its framework conditions. <br />
              <br />
              It is a forum for the  stakeholders of the industry, with a mandate to contribute to enhancing safety  in offshore activities, reduce the number of personnel injuries and  catastrophes, improve co-workers and their families&rsquo; confidence in the industry,  enhance trust and cooperation between the players of the industry and improve  the industry&rsquo;s reputation.<br />
              The project has been very  productive and developed a number of recommendations and guidelines. One  particularly outstanding achievement has been the development of uniform rules  for issuing Work Permits and carrying out Safe Job Analysis related to work on  installations. <br />
              <br />
              There are about 70  installations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, which are operated by 8  different oil and gas companies. Around one  thousand work permits are issued every day offshore. About 70 percent of the  workers, however, move between several installations and thus they encountered  new rules and procedures in each work place. This increased the risk of making  mistakes and entailed an increased safety risk as well. Working Together for  Safety prepared generic models for issuing Work Permits and carrying out Safe  Job Analysis. Thus, the project laid the foundation for achieving a uniform  practice for such tasks, which since 1. January 2004 apply to all installations  on the shelf. The achievement affects several thousand workers of the  Norwegian offshore industry. <br />
              <br />
            This excellent achievement has great potential for contributing to  enhance the safety of offshore operations in other regions of the world. The  forms and guidance on how to use them have been translated into English, and  there is also an e-learning course in English. All are published and freely  available at the Working Together for Safety&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.samarbeidforsikkerhet.no/">www.samarbeidforsikkerhet.no</a></p>
