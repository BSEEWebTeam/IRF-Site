			<h3>INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF DRILLING CONTRACTORS</h3>
			<p>The International Association of Drilling Contractors  &ldquo;Health, Safety, and Environmental Case Guideline&rdquo; was launched in October 2006  and since that time has become increasingly popular with offshore drilling  contractors in many areas around the world.&nbsp;  The &ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo; provides a framework for developing an integrated  health, safety and environmental management system for use in reducing the  risks associated with offshore drilling activities.</p>
			<p>The document provides the worldwide drilling industry  with a means of harmonizing global health, safety and environmental principles  applicable to mobile offshore drilling units into a single methodology tailored  to the offshore drilling contractor community.&nbsp;  Use of the &ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo; allows drilling contractors to align their  business activities with a variety of international standards and regulatory  requirements assuring transparency of operations on a global basis.</p>
			<p>As currently implemented, this offshore management  system represents a voluntary, core set of principles which can be applied to  any mobile offshore drilling unit regardless of geographic location.&nbsp; As such, the guidelines provide a sense of  consistency to operating personnel when conducting hazardous offshore drilling  operations.</p>
			<p>Though not compulsory, use of the &ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo; can  assist regulatory authorities when evaluating drilling contractors&rsquo; management  programs, providing them assurance that the program encompasses a series of  best industry practices designed to minimize the risks of operating  offshore.&nbsp; This framework will greatly  assist regulatory bodies, drilling contractors, and oil and gas producers in  achieving higher degrees of personnel safety and environmental protection  worldwide.</p>
			<p>The &ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo; are rapidly gaining worldwide  acceptance and exposure not only in North West Europe and Australia, but in  Cuba, Canada, Angola, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago.&nbsp; As large, multinational oil and gas  operators acknowledge the importance and benefits of the Health, Safety, and  Environmental Case Guidelines, their use may expand to other offshore oil and  gas provinces around the world.</p>
			<p>This excellent achievement has great potential for  enhancing the safety of offshore drilling operations worldwide and member  countries of the International Regulators&rsquo; Forum greatly appreciate the work  the International Association of Drilling Contractors has performed in developing  this document. </p>

			<h3>PETRÓLEO BRASILEIRO S.A.</h3>
			<p>Prior to 1995,  Petr&oacute;leo Brasileiro (Petrobras) was a self-regulated, fully integrated  Brazilian government-owned company having a monopoly in all sectors of the  Brazilian oil and gas industry (i.e., offshore and onshore exploration and  production, refining, transportation &nbsp;and distribution of oil and gas). &nbsp;Petrobras'  monopoly position in the Brazilian oil and gas market was ended by an act of  the Brazilian Congress in 1995. At 1997, ANP was created as an independent  Federal Government agency to oversee and regulate the commercial exploration,  development, and operational safety aspects of the offshore (upstream) sector  and downstream sectors of Brazil's oil and gas industry. Petrobras is now the  biggest oil company operating in Brazil, ranked 8th in the World National Oil  Companies (NOC) and 14th in the global ranking.</p>
			<p>In 2000, Petrobras started reformulating its HSE Management System and set 15  corporate guidelines based on five pillars: visible commitment, line  responsibility, deviation management, continuous learning and focus on human  behavior. The implementation of the new Top-down Process Safety Program was  supported by an investment of US $1.5 billion in the last year.</p>
			<p>The guideline related to acquisition of services has obtained outstanding  results and played a significant role in the global HSE performance, due to the  huge number of influenced contractors (220,000 persons, according to Company's  data). This corporate guideline includes HSE aspects in all stages of the  contracting process, in a structured and integrated manner.&nbsp; From 2000 to 2006 there was a tenfold  decrease in the Fatal Accidents Rate and a fivefold decrease in Lost Time  Injury Frequency, taking into account only contractors.</p>
			<p>This excellent self-initiative has great potential to improve the safety of  offshore operations not only in Brazil, but also in other regions of the world.  This award recognizes Petrobras leadership in raising safety awareness efforts  as a key driver for best sustainable business performance.</p>

			<h3>NETHERLANDS OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSOCIATION </h3>
			<p>In the Netherlands,  there are currently 14 operators active in the offshore and onshore oil and gas  industry and they employ around 2,500 people. Together, they produced 67  billion cubic metres of natural gas and 1.5 million cubic metres of oil in  2006. The operators are united in the Netherlands Oil and Gas Exploration and  Production Association(NOGEPA).</p>
			<p>The majority of  the work performed by the operators is carried out by contractors. It is estimated  that up to 15,000 contractors perform work for various operators on around 140  offshore platforms and 700 land locations. The Permit to Work (PtW) system is  an important tool in managing the risks related to the tasks to be executed. A  uniform PtW creates an excellent platform to effectively and jointly address  the risks of jobs to be executed by visiting contractors and company  site/platform personnel. All parties involved &ndash; oil and gas companies,  contractors and regulators &ndash; have for a long time recognized the potential  benefits of a uniform PtW system. Recommendations were made by the State  Supervision of Mines and the NOGEPA at the annual meeting that the oil and gas  producing industry should adopt a uniform PtW system.</p>
			<p>In 2003, the  NOGEPA Operation&rsquo;s Committee decided to develop one comprehensive PtW system  for the Dutch oil and gas industry. An important aid was the uniform PtW system  already developed by &lsquo;Deltalinqs&rsquo;; an association for the common interests of  the port and industrial companies, which operate mainly petrochemical and  chemical plants in the Rotterdam/Europoort industrial area. Two NOGEPA members  had already embraced this PtW system and many contractors in the Netherlands  were already familiar with it. Therefore, it was decided to concentrate on  investigating whether the Dutch oil and gas producers could join this system  too. A working group was formed within NOGEPA which reviewed the &rsquo;Deltalinqs&rsquo;  PtW system and produced a revised version of what became the &ldquo;Deltalinqs /  NOGEPA Permit to Work&rdquo;.&nbsp; This created a  unique situation in that a major part of the Dutch industry is now standardized  on one PtW system.</p>
			<p>By 2004 all the  NOGEPA members had standardized and implemented this system within their  operations.&nbsp; The PtW system includes a  Task Risk Analysis, an introduction package and is available in both Dutch and  English. The system proved to be effective in addressing the risks involved in  tasks to be executed in the field.&nbsp; This  was was confirmed by a subsequent State Supervision of Mines PtW inspection  project in 2006. The implementation of the uniform PtW system has been  perceived as a valuable improvement by the contractors active in the Dutch oil  and gas industry.</p>
			<p>Finally, this PtW  system has the potential to be adopted in other regions of the worldwide oil  and gas industry.</p>
