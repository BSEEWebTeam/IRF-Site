The main objective was to improve hydrocarbons' policy definition and implementation by creating a new technical and regulatory agency in the hydrocarbon sector - a check and balance system between PEMEX and the Ministry of Energy.</p>

			<p>The CNH regulates the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, in beds or reservoirs, whatever their physical state, including their intermediate states, and that are components of crude mineral oil, are associated with it or result from it, as well as processing activities, transportation and storage directly related to hydrocarbon exploration and production projects. This is done by delivering dictums of all PEMEX's projects before the beginning of exploration and exploitation activities. With these dictums, the CNH is responsible for safeguarding the nation's hydrocarbons and the means of extracting them. It is worth noting that the National Hydrocarbons Commission technical opinions are not influenced by any operator or institution working in the oil sector.</p></td>
