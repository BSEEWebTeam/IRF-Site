              <td valign="top"><p>The <a href="http://www.ptil.no/">PSA's webpage</a> is probably the most informative source of information about our regulatory system and activities. Almost everything we do and think of as a regulator is duly accounted for here.</p>
<p>Most of the postings are also published in English. (This costs us a bit, but we do it for the benefit of media and for our good colleagues in other countries!)</p>
<p>The website accounts for our organization and it also introduces you to some of the people that are happily working with the PSA, our day-to-day supervisory activities, and it features a number of articles related to regulatory professional issues. Statistics are posted here as well as our annual reports, such as the annual Risk Assessment Report and our annual report in magazine format – the Safety, Status and Signals, which has been well received by the industry as well as of our regulatory colleagues.</p>
<p>Should a major accident occur in Norwegian waters or onshore, the PSA will quickly mobilize its Emergency Response Team, not least in part to be able to inform the central government and the public about the position. The PSA website will also change to bring the latest news about an accident.</p>
<p>You might also want to know that the PSA has a dedicated special <a href="http://www.ptil.no/press-centre/deepwater-horizon-article6888-172.html">webpage</a> about what we as a regulator does in regard to the Deepwater Horizon/Macondo catastrophe.</p>
