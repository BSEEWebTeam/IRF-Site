			  <p>The <a href="http://www.ptil.no/">PSA's webpage</a> is probably the most informative source of information about organisation, regulatory system and activities.  The website accounts the day-to-day supervisory activities by publishing all audit reports as well as statutory decisions, and it features a number of articles related to regulatory professional issues. Statistics are posted on the website as annual reports, such as the annual Risk Assessment Report. The majority of the postings are also published in English.</p>
