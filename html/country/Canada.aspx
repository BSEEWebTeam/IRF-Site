However, the governments have established a formula fees schedule for the offshore boards to recover the costs associated with regulating offshore oil and gas activity from applicants and operators on behalf of both governments. The NEB budget is assigned by the federal government.</p>

			<p>The Boards undertake an environmental assessment of proposed projects to meet the environmental requirements set out in their respective enabling legislation. For major projects, such as the drilling, testing, and abandonment of an exploratory well in an area set out in one or more exploration licences or construction, installation, operation, decommissioning, and abandonment of an offshore floating or production platform used for the production of oil and gas, an environmental assessment is required pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012.</p>

			<td valign="top"><p>As part of a work or activity authorization application, an operator is required to submit to the relevant Board a plan(s) for response to safety or environmentally related emergencies including an oil spill response plan.</p>
			<p>In the event of a petroleum spill from its installation(s), the operator is responsible, as soon as possible, to:
			<ul>
			<li>take all reasonable measures consistent with safety and the protection of the environment to prevent any further spill;</li>
			<li>to repair or remedy any condition resulting from the spill, and;</li>
			<li>to reduce or mitigate any danger to life, health, property or the environment that results or may reasonably be expected to result from the spill.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>While the Boards are the lead government agency for spill response in their offshore areas, numerous agencies of the federal and provincial government, depending upon the precise circumstances of an individual spill event, may provide advice and support to the applicable Board in its interactions with the responsible operator.</p>
