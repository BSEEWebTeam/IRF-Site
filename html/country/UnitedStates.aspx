Planning for additional oil and gas exploration in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea is underway.</p>

Civil penalties may be issued when violations pose actual harm or threat of harm to personnel or the environment.</p>

The intent of the NEPA process is to help public officials make decisions based on an understanding of environmental consequences and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment. The NEPA established the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/">Council on Environmental Quality</a> (CEQ) to advise agencies on the environmental decision making process and to oversee and coordinate the development of Federal environmental policy. The CEQ issued regulations <a href="http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/ceq/toc_ceq.htm">(40 CFR 1500-1508)</a> in 1978 implementing NEPA. BSEE prepares environmental impact statements and environmental assessments at various stages including leasing, exploration plans and development plans. BSEE also coordinates with other Federal bureaus and agencies in reviewing environmental implications of planned OCS activities   </td>

Operators are required to submit Oil Spill Response Plans for approval by the Bureau. These plans must address worst case discharge and response capabilities including equipment and response time. BSEE conducts annual inspections of equipment and conducts drills to test industry response. Through a unified command structure, BSEE shares responsibility with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in incident response. The USCG acts as the Federal On Scene Coordinator and leads the operational spill response and BSEE focus is on source control.</td>
