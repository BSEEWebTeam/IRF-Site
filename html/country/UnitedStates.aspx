BSEE may assess civil penalties for failures to follow the law, regulations, licenses, permits, or orders.</p>

NEPA is a procedural stature that helps inform executive agency decision-making based on an understanding of environmental consequences and a meaningful evaluation of reasonable alternatives. The NEPA established the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq/">Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)</a> to advise agencies on the environmental decision-making process and to oversee and coordinate the development of Federal environmental policy. The CEQ issued regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508) in 1978 implementing NEPA, which were adopted by DoI. BSEE relies on the principles established by NEPA to inform its decision-making.</td>

              <td valign="top"><strong>Oil Spill Response:</strong></td>
              <td valign="top">BSEE oversees oil spill planning and preparedness for U.S. facilities located in both state and federal waters seaward of the coastline that handle, store or transport oil. This authority is granted through the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Executive Order 12777. BSEE reviews Oil Spill Response Plans (OSRPs) to verify that the owner or operator and any contract personnel have met all training and exercise requirements and are prepared to execute the plans; conducts unannounced exercises to test the plans; and verifies that the oil spill response equipment listed in the OSRP is maintained properly and readily available. BSEE also monitors oil spill incident reports, reviews and analyzes follow-up reports on spill responses for process improvement, provides technical assistance to Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSCs) in the event of an oil spill, and supports other actions taken by the Department of the Interior (DoI).  Finally, BSEE manages a robust oil spill research and development program.  For more than 25 years, BSEE has maintained a comprehensive, long-term research program dedicated to improving oil spill response options. The major focus of the program is to improve the methods and technologies used for oil spill detection, containment, treatment, recovery, and cleanup. BSEE has source control authority in the event of a blowout on the OCS.</td>
