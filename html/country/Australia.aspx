The prescribed management plans are essentially ‘permissioning’ documents and must be accepted by NOPSEMA prior to a duty-holder commencing an activity. The prescribed plans include:
                <ul>
                <li>safety cases</li>
                <li>well operations management plans</li>

              <td valign="top">General duties are imposed on operators of facilities, licence holders, persons in control of particular work, employers and others. Duties are performance based, with health and safety risks required to be reduced to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) and environmental impacts reduced to ALARP and acceptable levels. Regulations require that once the prescribed permissioning documents have been accepted by NOPSEMA, duty-holders must operate in accordance with the arrangements documented within the relevant safety case, well operations management plan or environment plan.
