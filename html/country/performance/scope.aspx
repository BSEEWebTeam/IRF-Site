          <h1>PROJECT GOAL</h1>
          <p>To measure and compare offshore safety performance among IRF participants by collecting and comparing incident data based on a common set of criteria.</p>
          <h1>OVERALL SCOPE OF THE DATA TO BE COLLECTED</h1>
          <ul>
            <li> Geographic location:  All offshore areas regulated by each country&rsquo;s agency will be included.</li>
            <li> Industry sector: <br />

          <h1>DATA ENTRY GUIDELINES</h1>
          <h3>REPORTING YEAR</h3>
          <p>The reporting year is based on the calendar year (January to December).</p>
          <h3>GENERAL GUIDELINE FOR ALL CATEGORIES</h3>
          <p>When submitting data, enter &ldquo;0&rdquo; when there were no incidents reported and &ldquo;NA&rdquo; when the information is not available either because of quality considerations or because it is not required to be reported to your agency. </p>
          <h3>FATALITIES</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Injuries and Fatalities are counted as the number of casualties rather than the number of incidents.</li>
            <li>The Fatality and Injury categories are not additive.  Each Fatality and Injury should be assigned to only one category.</li>
            <li> Fatalities and Injuries associated with Operational Incidents or Gas Releases will be counted both as a Fatality or Injury and as an Operational Incident or Gas Release.</li>
            <li> Include Fatalities and Injuries that occur while the worker is onsite at the Offshore Installation but is off-duty/off-shift.</li>
            <li>Do not include Fatalities and Injuries that occur while commuting to/from work (onshore). </li>
            <li> Do not include Fatalities and Injuries that are self-inflicted.</li>
            <li> Do not include Occupational Illnesses in Fatality or Injury counts.</li>
            <li>Utilize the definitions in the Appendix. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>HOURS WORKED</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> With two exceptions, the criteria for determining hours worked should parallel the criteria listed on page 1 under &ldquo;Overall Scope of the Data to be Collected.&rdquo;  The exceptions are that the activities associated with aviation and supply boats/standby vessels are excluded from the total number of hours worked. </li>
            <li>For countries that have available the number of workers instead of hours worked, use an average of 2000 hours per year as a multiplier to calculate the number of hours worked. </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>GAS RELEASES &ndash; NUMBER OF RELEASES</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>	The Major and Significant categories are not additive.  Each incident should be assigned to only one category.</li>
            <li>Include only process-related releases of gas that is being recovered from the reservoir.</li>
            <li>Releases resulting in a Fatality or Injury will be counted here and as a Fatality or Injury. </li>
            <li>Releases associated with Loss of Well Control related to production operations should be included.</li>
            <li>Releases associated with Losses of Well Control related to well activities (drilling, completion, workover, and abandonment) should not be included.  These incidents should be included in Losses of Well Control under &ldquo;Operational Incidents.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Any gas release with a rate less than 0.1 kg/sec or an amount less than 1 kg will be excluded.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>GAS RELEASES &ndash; AMOUNT OF RELEASES</h3>
          <p>Enter the total amount of Gas Released in the Major and Significant categories for the Reporting Year noted on the form.  For converting gas release volumes to gas release rates, we will use the following formula:</p>
          <p><strong>Gas Release Rate (kg/sec) = </strong></p>
          <p><strong>132.52 x</strong><strong> <img src="GasReleaseRate.gif" alt="Gas Release Rate" width="376" height="24" /></strong><strong><br />
              where d = equivalent hole diameter (mm) and gas density is given at the operating pressure.</strong></p>
          <h3>BOE GAS PRODUCTION</h3>
          <p>Use the following conversion factors to calculate gas production into barrels of oil equivalent (BOE): </p>
          <p>1 cubic metre of gas = 35.31 cubic feet of gas<br />
            1 cubic feet of gas = 1/5800 barrels of oil equivalent </p>
          <p>Hence, 1 cubic metre of gas = 35.31/5800 BOE or <strong>1 million cub metre</strong> of gas = <strong>6088</strong> BOE.</p>
          <p><em>(From the UK Department of Trade and Industry website)</em></p>
          <h3>COLLISIONS, FIRES, AND LOSSES OF WELL CONTROL</h3>
          <p>Enter the total number of Collisions, Fires/Explosions, and Losses of Well Control in the appropriate categories for the Reporting Year (Calendar Year) noted on the form. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>	The Major and Less Than Major categories are not additive.  Each incident should be assigned to only one category. </li>
            <li> Incidents that involve more than one type (such as:  a Collision that causes a Fire; a Gas Release that causes a Fire) should be placed in the category that represents the initiating event.</li>
            <li> Incidents resulting in a Fatality or Injury will be counted here and as a Fatality or Injury. </li>
            <li>Production-related Losses of Well Control should be included under Gas Releases.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Enter the total number of Offshore Installations (MODU&rsquo;s and Fixed/Floating Structures) and the Total number of well-related activities for the Reporting Year noted on the form.  &ldquo;Offshore Installations&rdquo; are defined on in the Appendix.  The number of MODUs will be calculated by determining the yearly average of the number of rigs operating offshore each month during the year.</p>
          <h3>WELL-RELATED ACTIVITIES </h3>
          <p>The total of the following: 1) the number of new wells spud plus 2) the number of wells re-entered for the purpose of reworking or abandonment during the Reporting Year.  Side tracks will only be counted as a separate well when a new bottom hole target is selected for geological reasons.</p>

          <p><strong>First Aid Injury</strong> &ndash; cases that are not sufficiently serious to be reported as medical treatment or more serious cases but nevertheless require minor first aid treatment, e.g. dressing on a minor cut, removal of a splinter from a finger.  <em>(From International Association of Oil and Gas Producers) - OGP - definition of First Aid Case &ndash; slightly modified)</em></p>
          <p><strong>Lost Workday Injury</strong> &ndash; any work-related injury other than a &ldquo;Major Injury&rdquo; which results in a person being unfit for work on any day after the day of occurrence of the injury.  Any day includes rest days, weekend days, leave days, public holidays, or days after ceasing employment.  <em>(From OGP definition of Lost Workday Case &ndash; slightly modified)</em></p>
          <p><strong>Major Injury</strong> &ndash; any work-related injury that results in one or more of the following:<br />
            -	Amputation:  Includes whole or partial amputation of parts of the body (does not include loss of fleshy tip of finger, nail, or tooth).<br />
            -	Skeletal injuries:  Includes bone fractures (including chipped or cracked bone or hairline fracture) and dislocation of shoulder, hip, knee of spine.  Does not include simple hairline fractures or fractures to fingers, thumbs, toes, or broken nose.<br />

          <p><strong>Occupational Illness</strong> &ndash; any abnormal condition or disorder, other than one resulting from an occupational injury, caused by exposure to environmental factors associated with employment. Occupational illness may be caused by inhalation, absorption, ingestion of, or direct contact with the hazard, as well as exposure to physical and psychological hazards. It will generally result from prolonged or repeated exposure. <em>(From OGP definition of occupational illness &ndash; modified)</em></p>
          <p><strong>Restricted Workday Injury</strong> &ndash; any work-related injury other than a &ldquo;Major Injury&rdquo; which results in a person being unfit for full performance of the regulator job on any day after the occupational injury.  Work performed might be:  an assignment to a temporary job; part-time work at the regular job; or working full-time in the regular job but not performing all the usual duties of the job.  Where no meaningful work is being performed, the incident should be recorded as a lost workday case.  <em>(From OGP definition of Restricted Work Case &ndash; slightly modified)</em></p>
          <p><strong>Work-Related (occupational) Injury</strong> &ndash; any injury which results from a work accident or from a single instantaneous exposure in the work environment.  Conditions resulting from animal bites, such as insect or snake bites, and from one-time exposure to chemicals are considered to be injuries.  Injuries and fatalities that occur while the worker is onsite at the Offshore Installation, but off duty/off-shift are included.  Self-inflicted injuries or fatalities are not included. <em>(From OGP definition of occupational injury &ndash; modified to add clarifying statements about off-shift and self-inflicted injuries)</em></p>
          <p><strong>III. Other Incident Types</strong></p>
