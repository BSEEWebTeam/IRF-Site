<H1>Introduction</H1>
<p>The IRF formed in 1993 to provide international leadership on safety and safety-related regulatory matters for offshore oil and gas activities, continue to strengthen sharing of regulatory practice and experience, and provide a sounding board for key initiatives of members.</p>
<p>The IRF hosts an Offshore Safety Conference every two to three years that brings together regulators, industry, researchers, non-profits and others to examine issues related to risks offshore and increase safety and environmental performance.</p>
<p>Members include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia - National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority</li>
<li>Brazil - National Agency of Oil, Gas and Biofuels</li>
<li>Canada - 
<ul>
<li>Canada - Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board</li>
<li>Canada - Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board</li>
<li>National Energy Board</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Denmark - Danish Working Environment Authority</li>
<li>Mexico - National Agency for Safety, Energy and Environment of Mexico</li>
<li>The Netherlands - State Supervision of Mines</li>
<li>New Zealand - WorkSafe New Zealand</li>
<li>Norway - The Petroleum Safety Authority</li>
<li>United Kingdom â€“ Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED)</li>
<li>United States - Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement</li>
</ul>
<H1>Objectives</H1>
<p>The objectives of the IRF are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote best sustainable safety performance globally.</li>
<li>To enable an exchange of information among regulators on:
<ul>
<li>Offshore health and safety trends;</li>
<li>Industry health and safety performance;</li>
<li>Lessons from incidents;</li>
<li>Industry practices;</li>
<li>Regulatory practice; and</li>
<li>Measuring the effectiveness of regulatory activities.</li>
</ul>
<li>To provide a network of offshore petroleum health and safety regulators for mutual support and advise when required.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are achieved through annual general meetings, continuous communication among members between annual meetings, and an IRF hosted conference every two to three years.</p>
<H1>Working Groups</H1>
<p>The IRF has four working groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asset Integrity - The purpose is to identify how companies are managing the maintenance of safety-critical equipment.</li>
<li>Culture - The purpose is to find a management number of elements/indicators of culture that impact process safety performance within the IRF member countries to prevent major hazard incidents.</li>
<li>Performance Measures - The purpose is to better identify risks and thereby focus IRF engagement with industry.</li>
<li>Standards - The purpose is to identify priorities for the development and / or revision of global standards applicable to the offshore oil and gas industry.</li>
</ul>
